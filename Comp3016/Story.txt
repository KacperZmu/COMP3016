and the soft crunch of fallen leaves beneath your feet echoes through the silence. You hear no other life around you.  
The twisted branches above form an intricate canopy that filters the pale moolight, casting an earie glow  
on the damp forest floor.  " 

"In the distance lies an imposing mansion, its' dark silhouette imposing against the fog laden backdrop.   
A palpable aura of corruption emanates from its' walls, whispering tales of secrets, long buried within.  
To the Left, a winding stretches endlessly into the unknown, with each visible bend revealing more mysteries than the last.
The air is filled with anticipation as you consider what lies beyond the seemingly infinite trail.  "

GoingRight

"As you cautiously veer right, your gaze fixates on the mysterious 
creature lurking in the shadows. The air thickens with an eerie 
tension, and an unnatural stillness envelopes the space around you.
The creature, a silhouette of twisted forms and gleaming eyes 
emerges slowly from the darkness. "

"A low, gutteral growl resonates through the air, sending shivers  
down your spine. The creatures' eyes lock onto yours. 
Its' features obscured by the foggy veil. Inseed whispers 
seem to emanate from its presence, weaving a chilling tapestry of 
unknown horrors. "

Killing it
"You.. Killed IT"


"As the creatures life fades, an ominous stillness settles upon
the sanctuary. With its last breath the creatures thoughts echo 
through your mind- a haunting revalation that it was a pacifist,
a guardian sworn to protect the very forest it inhabited."

"The world around you darkens, as if the shadows themselves
mourn the loss of their guardian. Whispers and distant screams 
permeate the air, carrying with them the weight of a forest left vulnerable. 
The once mutated cries of unseen creatures now crescendo into a canopy of
despair."

"You stand alone, the unintended executioner of a silent protector.
the responsibility to safeguard the sanctuary now falls upon your shoulders. 
Will you honour the fallen guardians last wishes, and slowly turn into 
creature itself? or will you go on, after all, youre just a 
Death
"You...Died"

"As you cautiously approach the mansion, the fog seems to thicken, 
swirling around the looming structure like ghostly tendrils. 
The air becomes charged with an unsetlling energy, with distant howls 
of unkown creatures you've never heard before, ehcoing through the
twisted corridors of the forrest"

"The mansions grand entrance stands before you, its' once
opulent facade now marred by time, and an ominous air of 
malevolance brushes against you. As you step forth towards the gate,
a creature resembling a phantom apears before you"

'Be gone foul being!' the creature squeals with a heavy rasp
'Your kind doesn't belong here. Tonight you will take your last breath!'"
